# FiltrFindr Project

## Info

**Name:** Mayur Soneji

**Student Number:** 96455016

**Course:** WEB14203

### Introduction

In this brief we were asked to experiement with a variety of new tools and implement those tools with Javascript. The project idea revolves on a location based service which assists people who want to learn coding to find teachers. After many hours trying to fix my broken code, I was more happier with the outcome. There were limitations where I couldn't get help with such as adding a pin to the locations of the teachers, save this for another rainy day I guess :D.
